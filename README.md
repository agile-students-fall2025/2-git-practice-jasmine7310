[Can AI Really Code? Study Maps Roadblocks to Autonomous Software Engineering by Rachel Gordon](https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716)

### What I found interesting about the article
The article discusses some of the current challenges and expectations of AI, as well as the speculations around it. From messy superficial unit tests to having trouble processing large amounts of code, AI struggles with the tasks day-to-day software engineers go through with ease. What I found interesting was the perspective that AI should be developed to enchance the performance of current software developersâ€” not to replace them. With the current development of AI and its successes and failures, I can also say the same.


### My Opinion - [Arda Bakici](https://github.com/ArdaBakici)
This is a very interesting article since talks about the fact that AI is good at Leetcode style single problems which is far from the reality of real life software development. I also like the quote from article *"popular narratives often shrink software engineering to "the undergrad programming part"* which is something I agree with. AI coding companions really struggle with large codebases. 

### My Opinion - [Yifan Zuo](https://github.com/EvanZuo1108)
This article is really impressive. If AI tools improve in the ways suggested, we may see a shift in what software engineer roles look like. More time spent on high-level design, architectural decisions, specification, security, and less on boilerplate, tedious refactors, migrating old code, etc.
